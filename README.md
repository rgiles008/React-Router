## **Description**

A Front level application with multiple pages and links making use of React Router and its libraries.  The application creates links
using the {Link} and {NavLink} while also nesting routes within paths for links to other tabs on the page.  There is a form field for searching
out a teacher or subject that will display the teachers name and topic using the {match} property.  The page uses template literals to set 
parameters to sort through and the {match} property will designates the url and matches the path while keeping the user on the page they last
viewed using the history prop.  Very basic use of Router in React
